Loan Approval Prediction Web App (Flask + ML)

## Overview

This project is a Flask web application that predicts loan approval based on user-provided information. It serves a trained machine learning model and includes a separate training script to build and evaluate traditional ML ensembles.

## Pipeline configuration
# Reproducing the Deployment

This project uses GitHub Actions secrets to deploy securely to a Google VM. These secrets are not committed to the repository and are not visible to users who clone or fork the repo.

To recreate the deployment, the following repository secrets must be created in GitHub:

| Secret | Purpose |
|---|---|
| `VM_HOST` | External IP address of the Google VM |
| `VM_USER` | SSH username used by GitHub Actions |
| `VM_SSH_KEY` | Private SSH key used by GitHub Actions to connect to the VM |
| `ACTIONS_PUSH_TOKEN` | GitHub token used by workflows that commit model/retraining/rollback changes back to the repository |

The VM must be pre-provisioned with:

- Docker
- Git
- SSH access
- Firewall rule allowing HTTP traffic on port 80
- Repository cloned to `/opt/mlops/loan-approval-prediction`
- User permissions to run Docker

The deployment workflow is reproducible once these environment-specific secrets and VM prerequisites are configured. The secrets are intentionally excluded from the repository for security reasons.



## Features

- End-to-end loan approval prediction web UI built with Flask
- Robust preprocessing with `RobustScaler` and categorical encoders saved via `joblib`
- PyTorch inference model (`model.pth`) with advanced architecture
- Optional traditional ML ensemble training (`train_ensemble.py`)
- Clear results page showing predicted decision and confidence
- Defensive input validation with helpful error messages

## Tech Stack

- Python, Flask
- PyTorch (inference model loaded from `model.pth`)
- scikit-learn (preprocessing + alternative ensemble model in `train_ensemble.py`)
- numpy, pandas, joblib, matplotlib

## Code Overview

- `app.py`: Flask routes, input validation, feature engineering, categorical encoding, scaling, PyTorch model loading, and prediction logic. Produces a confidence score for classification.
- `train_ensemble.py`: Loads `LAP.csv`, performs extensive feature engineering, trains multiple scikit-learn models, evaluates, and saves preprocessing artifacts and an ensemble checkpoint.
- `templates/`: HTML templates (`index.html`, `results.html`) for the web UI.
- `model.pth`: PyTorch model state dict used by the web app.
- `scaler.pkl`, `label_encoders.pkl`, `label_encoder_target.pkl`: Preprocessing artifacts saved with `joblib`.

## Project Description

This application demonstrates a practical ML workflow: a trained model is packaged with its preprocessing artifacts and served via a simple Flask interface. The app collects core applicant details, derives additional predictive features, applies encoders/scaling, and performs a prediction with a confidence score. The result is presented as an eligibility decision (Yes/No) along with a confidence threshold to avoid overconfident outputs on uncertain inputs.

The repository also includes a separate training script (`train_ensemble.py`) that builds classic ML baselines (RandomForest, GradientBoosting, LogisticRegression) and an ensemble for comparison and experimentation.

## Inputs Collected

- Loan_ID, Gender, Married, Dependents, Education, Self_Employed
- ApplicantIncome, CoapplicantIncome, LoanAmount, Loan_Amount_Term
- Credit_History, Property_Area

Derived features include Total Income, Income-to-Loan ratio, Loan-to-Income ratio, and categorical bins for income/loan levels.

## Quickstart

1) Create a virtual environment and activate it

```bash
python -m venv .venv
.venv\Scripts\activate  # Windows PowerShell
```

2) Install dependencies

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

3) Run the web app

```bash
python app.py
```

Then open `http://127.0.0.1:5000` in your browser.

## Training (optional)

If you want to retrain preprocessing and an ensemble model (RandomForest, GradientBoosting, LogisticRegression), run:

```bash
python train_ensemble.py
```

This will output updated artifacts like `scaler.pkl`, `label_encoders.pkl`, and `label_encoder_target.pkl`. The script also saves `ensemble_model.pkl` for reference; the Flask app loads the PyTorch model from `model.pth` for inference.

## How it works

1) User submits the form at `/` (`templates/index.html`).
2) `app.py` validates inputs, engineers additional features, encodes categoricals, and scales numerics.
3) The preprocessed vector is passed to the PyTorch model loaded from `model.pth`.
4) The output is interpreted (classification with confidence) and shown on `/results`.

### Routes

- `/`: Home page with input form
- `/results`: Results page with prediction and confidence

## Deployment

- Production WSGI (example):
  - `pip install gunicorn waitress`
  - Gunicorn (Linux): `gunicorn -w 2 -b 0.0.0.0:8000 app:app`
  - Waitress (Windows): `waitress-serve --listen=0.0.0.0:8000 app:app`
- Cloud (Render/Heroku):
  - Set Python version and install from `requirements.txt`.
  - Ensure artifacts (`model.pth`, `scaler.pkl`, `label_encoders.pkl`, `label_encoder_target.pkl`) are deployed.
  - Set environment variable `FLASK_SECRET` (optional) for session security.

## Environment Variables

- `FLASK_SECRET`: Optional; if set, overrides `app.secret_key` in `app.py`.

## Notes

- The Flask app expects the preprocessing artifacts (`scaler.pkl`, `label_encoders.pkl`, `label_encoder_target.pkl`) to be present in the project root.
- The dataset `LAP.csv` is used by the training script only. The web app does not require it at runtime.
- To replace the inference model, update `model.pth` and ensure its input feature ordering matches the preprocessing pipeline.

## How to publish on GitHub

1) Initialize git (inside the project folder):

```bash
git init
git add .
git commit -m "Initial commit: Loan approval prediction app"
```

2) Create a new empty repository on GitHub (no README/.gitignore). Then connect and push:

```bash
git branch -M main
git remote add origin https://github.com/<your-username>/<your-repo>.git
git push -u origin main
```
